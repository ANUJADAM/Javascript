1. What are objects
2. How are objects different from variables
3. Why do we need object

What are objects:

● An object is an entity (properties and method) with a certain state and
behavior. Examples include a car, pen, bicycle, chair, glass, keyboard, and
monitor.
● Objects can contain many values.
● Object values are written as key : value pairs (key and value separated by a
colon)

Example for better understanding:

                            Car (object)

    Attributes/Data                                 Behaviour

    Name,                                                Can start,
    Manufacturer,                                        Can stop,
    Fuel Capacity                                        Can accelerate


Example for better understanding
Name: Honda City, Manufacturer: Honda, Fuel capacity: 40 
Name: Seltos, Manufacturer: Kia, Fuel capacity: 50 
Variables                                         Objects
A variable is a named stored location           Object is just a name given to user-defined variables
which holds a value 
A variable can be initialized in a usual        Objects are declared and initialized as per the developer’s wish
manner.
A variable can contain only one value           An object contains multiple values
at a time 
Eg. let name, var age, etc.                     Eg.let person = {firstName:"ABC", lastName:"XYZ", age:20}

Why do we need objects:

● Variables limit us to handling only one value at a time whereas objects enable
us to have multiple values of multiple data types to be stored under one name.
● This not only gives the privilege of escaping many variables for our
applications but also organizes the code for better data handling.
● Objects are a boon for developers to develop applications that we see in the
current web world.
● Objects give us the liberty to see and implement the scenarios in real-world
form rather than disconnecting the actual application from the implemented
one.*/
