Arrays in JavaScript
What is an Array?
An array in JavaScript is a data structure that stores an ordered list of elements. It
can hold elements of any data type, including numbers, strings, objects, and
even other arrays. Arrays are a type of object in JavaScript and have a number of
built-in methods for adding, removing, and manipulating elements.

What do we need Arrays in JavaScript?
● Grouping related data
● Storing large amount of data
● Improving performance
● Ease of use
● Better readability

Declaration of Array
1. Using square brackets [ ]
2. Using an Array constructor
3. Using an Array literal

Array Indexing and Storing
Indexing and storing in arrays are related concepts in JavaScript. The index of an
element in an array determines its position within the array while storing in an
array refers to the act of assigning a value to an element within the array.

Accessing elements in an Array
Accessing elements in an array in JavaScript is done using the square bracket
notation and an index number. The index number represents the position of the
element within the array, starting from 0 for the first element, 1 for the second
element, and so on.
